<h1>ABOUT PAGE</h1>

<p>Hi it's wonderful that you wish to know more about our company. We hope this page satiates your interest of our path through the changing times</p>
<br>
<p>Our Technical Support company has a long and storied history having been in the business for over 30+ years.</p>

<p> To start from the beginning what you see here was not always the case. Like most companies we had to start from somewhere<p>

<p> And that somewhere was a small unassuming basement in the city of Stirling, Scotland. Started by our illustrious founders B.Mc, A.Lin and K.Soft in 1983<p>

<p> Fun fact: Our initial name was FunDa Chickens which really set us apart from the crowd during the turbulent beginning years of online business<p>

<p> As the wild west of online business began to become civilised it was decided upon a change of name to better reflect the changing times. So it was decided that in 1992 our companies new name would be McLinSoft. Which we have kept to this very day.<p>

<p> Due to internal conflicts during the year of 1993. It was mutually decided that McLinSoft would temporarily cease trading until which time a clear and concise goal could be formed by all members.<p>

<p> Luckily in 1996 the company began trading again with a concise goal of large proportions. With eyes set on the world the company began to make large strides in order to fufill it's new vision.<p>

<p> From 2001-2008 the company began to find it's footing though the footing in question has been treacherous.<p>

<p> From 2011-2016 the company expanded to include offices in Glasgow,Edinburgh and Aberdeen due to sound judgement and professional conduct.<p>

<h2> Future Plans <h2>

<br>

<p> As of 2017 and beyond we are happy to announce our plans to put an office on the new lunar colony going from a small basement to the very heavens themselves<P>
